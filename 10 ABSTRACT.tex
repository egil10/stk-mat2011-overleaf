High-frequency foreign exchange (FX) markets exhibit complex behaviors that challenge standard linear time series models. While daily returns often appear random, tick-by-tick data reveals significant short-term dependence driven by market microstructure effects. This project investigates the modeling of time-varying short-term dependence in FX data using a Regime-Switching Autoregressive model formulated as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). By decomposing the observed price into a latent efficient price and microstructure noise, we apply pre-averaging techniques to mitigate noise before estimating dependence regimes. We aim to capture the switching behavior between noise-dominated periods and momentum-driven price runs, comparing the HMM approach against static baseline models and online adaptive estimators.
