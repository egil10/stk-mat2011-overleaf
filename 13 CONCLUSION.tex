\section{Project Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{February:} Literature review on HMMs and high-frequency econometrics. Data acquisition from HistData (EUR/USD) and implementation of pre-averaging techniques to handle microstructure noise.
    \item \textbf{March:} Implementation of the baseline single-regime Autoregressive (AR) model. Development of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with regime-switching AR dynamics in Python/R.
    \item \textbf{April:} Extension of the model to include regime-dependent volatility (ARCH/GARCH effects). Calibration and validation of the model against the baseline using in-sample and out-of-sample testing.
    \item \textbf{May (1--15):} Final interpretation of regime-switching results (identifying noise vs. momentum states), final write-up of the thesis, and preparation of the code repository.
\end{itemize}
